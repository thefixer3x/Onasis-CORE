# Critical Issues & Repo Sync Summary

## üî¥ CRITICAL: Database Connection Issue

### Current Status
- **auth-gateway service**: ‚úÖ Running (stable, 0 restarts)
- **Database connection**: ‚ùå FAILING - Neon WebSocket error
- **Service health**: Service responds but cannot connect to database

### Error
```
"error": "All attempts to open a WebSocket to connect to the database failed"
```

### Impact
- Service can respond to HTTP requests
- Cannot perform database operations
- Auth functionality will fail

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
PM2 service was crashing continuously due to ESM module resolution errors when running compiled JavaScript.

### The Solution
1. **Created `start.js`** - TypeScript loader using `tsx` for runtime compilation
2. **Updated `ecosystem.config.js`** - Changed from `dist/index.js` to `start.js`
3. **Fixed all imports** - Added `.js` extensions to 11 TypeScript files

### Why It Works
- `tsx` handles TypeScript compilation at runtime
- No module resolution issues
- Same behavior in local and production

## Committing Changes

### Current Location
```bash
cd /opt/lanonasis/onasis-core
```

### Review Staged Changes
```bash
git diff --cached --stat
```

### Commit Command
```bash
git commit -m "fix(auth-gateway): stabilize PM2 service with TypeScript loader

BREAKING CHANGE: PM2 configuration now uses start.js instead of dist/index.js

- Add start.js TypeScript loader using tsx for runtime compilation
- Update ecosystem.config.js to use start.js instead of dist/index.js
- Add .js extensions to all ESM imports (11 files) for Node.js compatibility
- Fixes ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors that caused continuous service crashes
- Service now stable with 0 restarts and 17+ hours uptime

Changes from production deployment on Oct 22, 2025
Syncing local and production environments for CI/CD consistency"
```

### Push to Remote
```bash
git push origin main
```

## For Local Development

### After Pulling These Changes

#### Option 1: Development Mode (Recommended)
```bash
cd services/auth-gateway
npm run dev
```
Runs with `tsx watch` - auto-reloads on changes

#### Option 2: Production Mode with PM2
```bash
cd services/auth-gateway
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```
Uses `start.js` TypeScript loader (same as production)

#### Option 3: Traditional Build
```bash
cd services/auth-gateway
npm run build
npm start
```
Still works, but not recommended (uses compiled dist/)

## Database Configuration Issue

### Problem
Neon database WebSocket connection is failing. This needs to be fixed separately.

### Required Environment Variables
Make sure your `.env` file has:

```bash
# Neon Database (Required)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Optional Neon URLs
DIRECT_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."
SERVICE_ROLE_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."

# Supabase (Optional but recommended)
SUPABASE_URL="https://..."
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="..."
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY="..."
SUPABASE_AUTH_URL="https://.../auth/v1"
```

### Possible Causes
1. Network/firewall blocking WebSocket connections
2. Neon database not accessible from VPS
3. Missing or incorrect DATABASE_URL in production environment
4. DNS resolution issues for Neon endpoint

### To Investigate
```bash
# Test database connection directly
cd /opt/lanonasis/services/auth-gateway
node -e "const { Pool } = require('@neondatabase/serverless'); const ws = require('ws'); require('dotenv').config(); const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL }); pool.query('SELECT NOW()').then(r => console.log('Connected:', r.rows[0])).catch(e => console.log('Error:', e.message));"
```

## Context Alignment Summary

### What's Now Aligned Between Local & Production

‚úÖ **PM2 Configuration**: Both use `start.js` TypeScript loader
‚úÖ **Import Extensions**: All files have `.js` extensions  
‚úÖ **Module Resolution**: Same ESM handling via tsx
‚úÖ **Build Process**: No build step required in either environment
‚úÖ **Error Handling**: Same runtime behavior

### What Still Differs

‚ö†Ô∏è **Environment Variables**: Production has real credentials, local needs `.env`
‚ö†Ô∏è **Database Connection**: Production has WebSocket issue (needs investigation)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Network Configuration**: VPS-specific settings vs localhost

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Do Now)
1. ‚úÖ **Commit the staged changes** to sync repo with production
2. üî¥ **Investigate database connection** - critical for functionality
3. ‚úÖ **Test locally** after pulling changes

### Follow-up
1. Fix Neon database WebSocket connection
2. Add SUPABASE_AUTH_URL to production .env if needed
3. Document any VPS-specific configuration requirements
4. Consider adding database connection retry logic

## Testing Checklist

After committing, test locally:

- [ ] Clone/recreate repo locally
- [ ] Run `npm install`
- [ ] Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in values
- [ ] Run `npm run dev` - should start without errors
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl http://localhost:4000/health`
- [ ] Test with PM2: `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js`
- [ ] Verify database connection works locally
- [ ] Push changes and verify CI/CD passes
