# URGENT: Credential Leak - Action Required

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Status:** üî¥ REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION  
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## TL;DR - What You Need To Do

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ ROTATE CREDENTIALS NOW (5 minutes)
Go to https://app.supabase.com and rotate the service key for project `mxtsdgkwzjzlttpotole`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ RUN CLEANUP SCRIPT (10 minutes)
```bash
cd /path/to/Onasis-CORE
./scripts/cleanup-credential-leak.sh
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ INSTALL PREVENTION TOOLS (5 minutes)
```bash
./scripts/setup-security-hooks.sh
```

## What Happened?

Test Supabase credentials were accidentally committed to Git on **August 21, 2025**. Despite two attempts to sanitize the file (Aug 26 and later), the credentials remain in the Git history.

### Exposed Credentials

**Supabase Service Key** (full admin access):
```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6Im14dHNkZ2t3emp6bHR0cG90b2xlIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzEwNTI1OSwiZXhwIjoyMDYyNjgxMjU5fQ.Aoob84MEgNV-viFugZHWKodJUjn4JOQNzcSQ57stJFU
```

**Affected Commits:**
- `376fd79` - Initial commit
- `c525355` - First cleanup attempt
- `42b01ef` - Second cleanup attempt

**File:** `MCP_SERVER_CHECKPOINT.md`

---

## Why This Matters

‚úÖ The current file uses placeholders (good!)  
‚ùå But credentials are still in Git history (bad!)

Anyone with repository access can:
- View the full Git history
- Extract the credentials
- Access your Supabase database with admin rights

**Databases at risk:**
- memories (vector storage)
- organizations
- projects
- api_keys
- users

---

## Step-by-Step Remediation

### Step 1: Rotate Credentials (DO THIS FIRST!)

Even after cleaning Git history, the credentials may have been exposed. They **must** be rotated immediately.

**Instructions:**
1. Go to: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select project: `mxtsdgkwzjzlttpotole`
3. Navigate to: **Settings ‚Üí API**
4. Find: "Service role key" section
5. Click: **"Generate new key"**
6. Copy the new key
7. Update in all these locations:
   - Production `.env` files
   - CI/CD pipeline secrets
   - Netlify/Vercel/Railway environment variables
   - Any other deployment services
8. **Revoke the old key** in Supabase

‚è±Ô∏è **Estimated time:** 5-10 minutes

---

### Step 2: Clean Git History

Run the automated cleanup script:

```bash
cd /path/to/Onasis-CORE
./scripts/cleanup-credential-leak.sh
```

The script will:
1. ‚úÖ Create a backup of your repository
2. ‚úÖ Guide you through 3 cleanup methods
3. ‚úÖ Remove credentials from all Git history
4. ‚úÖ Offer to force push the cleaned history

**Choose your method:**
- **Option 1**: git-filter-repo (Recommended)
- **Option 2**: BFG Repo-Cleaner (Fast alternative)
- **Option 3**: git filter-branch (Built-in, slower)

‚è±Ô∏è **Estimated time:** 10-15 minutes

**Important:** After force pushing, all team members must update their repositories:
```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main
git reflog expire --expire=now --all
git gc --prune=now --aggressive
```

---

### Step 3: Install Prevention Tools

Prevent this from happening again:

```bash
./scripts/setup-security-hooks.sh
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Install pre-commit hooks to catch credentials
- ‚úÖ Configure git-secrets (if installed)
- ‚úÖ Update .gitignore if needed

‚è±Ô∏è **Estimated time:** 5 minutes

---

### Step 4: Verify Success

After cleanup, verify credentials are gone:

```bash
./scripts/verify-cleanup.sh
```

This checks:
- ‚úÖ No credentials in Git history
- ‚úÖ No credentials in current files
- ‚úÖ Placeholders are used in documentation
- ‚úÖ Security measures are in place
