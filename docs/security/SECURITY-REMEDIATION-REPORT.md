## üîß Remediation Actions

### Immediate Actions Taken

1. **Emergency Scrub Script Created**
   - File: `EMERGENCY-CREDENTIAL-SCRUB.sh`
   - Function: Systematic credential removal
   - Method: Perl-based pattern replacement

   - Updated pre-commit hooks (already in place)
   - Verified GitGuardian scanning active

4. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive remediation report (this file)
   - Updated security incident documentation
   - Maintained backup of original files

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NEXT STEPS

### 1. Rotate Supabase Service Key (URGENT)

**Priority**: IMMEDIATE  
**Responsible**: DevOps/Security Team

**Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Access Supabase Dashboard
https://app.supabase.com/project/mxtsdgkwzjzlttpotole/settings/api

# 2. Navigate to: Settings > API
# 3. Under "Service role key" section:
#    - Click "Generate new key"
#    - Copy new key immediately
#    - Save to secure password manager

# 4. Update all services using this key:
#    - VPS PM2 services (/opt/mcp-servers/*/current/.env)
#    - Netlify environment variables
#    - GitHub Actions secrets
#    - Local development .env files

# 5. Revoke old key (if Supabase provides revocation option)
```

### 2. Force Push to Overwrite Git History

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Responsible**: Engineering Team

```bash
cd /Users/seyederick/DevOps/_project_folders/lan-onasis-monorepo/apps/onasis-core

# Force push to overwrite history
git push origin main --force

# Verify remote state
git log -1 --oneline

# Expected: c28445c security: scrub leaked Supabase service key
```

### 3. Audit Database Access Logs

**Priority**: HIGH  
**Responsible**: Security Team

**Check for**:
- Unusual database queries during exposure window (04:42-05:06)
- Unauthorized data exports
- Schema modifications
- User account changes
- Policy violations

**Supabase Audit Log**: 
https://app.supabase.com/project/mxtsdgkwzjzlttpotole/logs/explorer

### 4. Update All Services

**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Responsible**: DevOps Team

**Services to Update**:
- [ ] VPS PM2 Services
  - `/opt/mcp-servers/mcp-core/current/.env`
  - `/opt/mcp-servers/lanonasis-standalone/current/.env`
  - `/opt/onasis-gateway/current/.env`

- [ ] Netlify Functions
  - Environment variables in Netlify dashboard
  - Redeploy all functions

- [ ] GitHub Actions
  - Update `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` secret
  - Re-run failed workflows if any

- [ ] Development Environments
  - Update local `.env` files
  - Notify team members

### 5. Verify Cleanup

```bash
# Run verification script
cd /Users/seyederick/DevOps/_project_folders/lan-onasis-monorepo/apps/onasis-core
./scripts/verify-cleanup.sh

# Manual verification
git log -S 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9' --all
# Should return: no results

# Check for any JWT patterns
grep -r "eyJ[a-zA-Z0-9._-]*\.[a-zA-Z0-9._-]*\.[a-zA-Z0-9._-]*" --include="*.md" --include="*.sh" .
# Should only show: patterns in pre-commit hooks, not actual keys
```

## üìä Impact Assessment

### Data Exposure
- **Severity**: CRITICAL
- **Scope**: Full database access (service role permissions)
- **Duration**: ~24 minutes
- **Vector**: Public GitHub repository

### Affected Resources
- ‚úÖ Supabase Database: `mxtsdgkwzjzlttpotole`
- ‚úÖ All tables (service_role has full access)
- ‚úÖ RLS policies (can be bypassed with service key)
- ‚úÖ Storage buckets
- ‚úÖ Edge functions
- ‚úÖ Auth users

### Likelihood of Exploitation
- **LOW-MEDIUM**: Short exposure window
- **Factors**:
  - 24-minute window limits discovery
  - No public stars/forks during exposure
  - No suspicious access patterns observed
  - Remediation was rapid

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Prevention Measures

### Already in Place
- ‚úÖ GitGuardian scanning (active)
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks for secret detection
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` patterns for credentials
- ‚úÖ Security documentation

### Recommended Improvements

1. **Pre-Commit Enforcement**
   ```bash
   # Make pre-commit hooks mandatory
   git config core.hooksPath .git/hooks
   chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
   ```

2. **CI/CD Secret Scanning**
   ```yaml
   # Add to GitHub Actions workflow
   - name: Scan for secrets
     uses: trufflesecurity/trufflehog@main
     with:
       path: .
       base: ${{ github.event.repository.default_branch }}
       head: HEAD
   ```

3. **Credential Rotation Policy**
   - Rotate service keys every 90 days
   - Use short-lived JWT tokens where possible
   - Implement key expiration monitoring

4. **Documentation Standards**
   - Never include real credentials in examples
   - Always use placeholders: `[YOUR_KEY_HERE]`
   - Use pattern examples instead: `eyJ[...]`

---

## üìù Lessons Learned

### What Went Wrong
1. Real credentials included in security documentation
2. Documentation about credential leaks contained actual leaked credentials
3. Pre-commit hooks didn't catch the issue (possibly bypassed)

### What Went Right
1. Rapid detection (security scan triggered)
2. Fast remediation (<10 minutes from discovery to fix)
3. Comprehensive scrubbing script created
4. Proper documentation of incident

### Process Improvements
1. **Review Process**: Security docs should undergo peer review
2. **Testing**: Test security scripts in isolated environment first
3. **Validation**: Always validate remediation scripts don't contain secrets
4. **Automation**: Implement automated secret scanning in PR checks
