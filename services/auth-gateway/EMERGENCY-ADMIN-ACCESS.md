## üöÄ How to Use Emergency Access

curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/admin/bypass-login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@lanonasis.com",
    "password": "LanonasisAdmin2025!"
  }'
```

### Production Login

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "admin@lanonasis.com",
    "password": "LanonasisAdmin2025!"
  }'
```

---

## ‚úÖ What You Get

**Response includes**:
```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGc...",
  "expires_in": 604800,
  "user": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "email": "admin@lanonasis.com",
    "full_name": "Lanonasis System Administrator",
    "role": "admin_override",
    "bypass_all_checks": true,
    "metadata": {
      "role": "super_admin",
      "permissions": ["*"],
      "bypass": true
    }
  },
  "message": "Admin bypass login successful - you have full system access"
}
```

---

## üîë Using the Admin Token

Once you have the token, use it for ALL API calls:

```bash
# Save token
export ADMIN_TOKEN="your_access_token_here"

# Check admin status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:4000/admin/status

# Access ANY protected endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:4000/v1/auth/sessions
```

---

## üîÑ Change Password (Recommended)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/admin/change-password \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "current_password": "LanonasisAdmin2025!",
    "new_password": "YourNewSecurePassword123!"
  }'
```

**Requirements**:
- New password must be at least 12 characters
- Must provide current password

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### 1. Database Level Protection
- Admin accounts stored in `auth_gateway.admin_override` table
- **Completely separate** from regular authentication
- Cannot be deleted by normal auth flows

### 2. Never Expires
- Admin sessions stored in `auth_gateway.admin_sessions`
- `never_expires = true`
- You will NEVER be locked out due to session expiry

### 3. Bypass All Checks
- `bypass_all_checks = true`
- No rate limiting
- No MFA requirements
- No account lockouts
- Always works even if:
  - Supabase is down
  - Regular auth is broken
  - Database RLS is misconfigured
  - OAuth providers are unavailable

### 4. Complete Audit Trail
- Every admin login logged to `auth_gateway.admin_access_log`
- Track when and where you accessed
- Monitor for unauthorized use

---

## üìä View Admin Activity

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:4000/admin/status
```

**Shows**:
- Your admin profile
- Last 10 actions
- Login history
- Access patterns

---

## üö® Emergency Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Regular auth system is broken
```bash
# Use admin bypass - it's completely independent
curl -X POST https://api.lanonasis.com/admin/bypass-login \
  -d '{"email":"admin@lanonasis.com","password":"LanonasisAdmin2025!"}'
```

### Scenario 2: Supabase credentials are wrong
```bash
# Admin bypass doesn't use Supabase at all
# Direct Neon database authentication
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/admin/bypass-login \
  -d '{"email":"me@seyederick.com","password":"LanonasisAdmin2025!"}'
```

### Scenario 3: Forgot regular user password
```bash
# Login as admin, then use admin powers to reset any user
# (Implementation: create user reset endpoint using admin token)
```

### Scenario 4: Account locked out
```bash
# Admin bypass has no lockout mechanism
# Always works, always accessible
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Location

**Schema**: `auth_gateway`
**Tables**:
- `admin_override` - Admin accounts (2 accounts)
- `admin_sessions` - Never-expiring admin sessions
- `admin_access_log` - Complete audit trail

**Direct Database Access** (if needed):
```sql
-- View admin accounts
SELECT email, full_name, bypass_all_checks, last_login_at
FROM auth_gateway.admin_override;

-- View admin sessions
SELECT admin_id, created_at, last_used_at, never_expires
FROM auth_gateway.admin_sessions;

-- View admin activity
SELECT admin_email, action, success, created_at
FROM auth_gateway.admin_access_log
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

---

## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Change Default Password Immediately

```bash
# After first login, change password
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/admin/change-password \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "current_password": "LanonasisAdmin2025!",
    "new_password": "YourUniqueStrongPassword123!"
  }'
```

### 2. Store Credentials Securely
- **Do NOT** commit this file to git
- Store in password manager (1Password, LastPass, etc.)
- Keep a backup in a secure location
- Consider encrypting this file

### 3. Monitor Admin Access
- Regularly check `admin_access_log`
- Alert on unexpected admin logins
- Review admin activity weekly

### 4. Protect This File
```bash
# Encrypt this file
gpg -c EMERGENCY-ADMIN-ACCESS.md

# Store encrypted version only
rm EMERGENCY-ADMIN-ACCESS.md
```

## üìù Adding New Admin Accounts

To add more admin accounts:

```sql
-- Connect to Neon
psql "$DATABASE_URL"

-- Add new admin
INSERT INTO auth_gateway.admin_override (email, password_hash, full_name, metadata)
VALUES (
  'newadmin@example.com',
  '$2b$12$...',  -- Generate with bcrypt
  'New Admin Name',
  '{"role": "admin", "permissions": ["*"], "bypass": true}'::jsonb
);
```

Generate password hash:
```bash
node -e "
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');
const password = 'YourPassword123!';
const hash = bcrypt.hashSync(password, 12);
console.log('Hash:', hash);
"
```

## üß™ Testing Script

Quick test script included:

```bash
cd services/auth-gateway
./test-admin-login.sh
```

**What it tests**:
- ‚úÖ Admin bypass login
- ‚úÖ Token generation
- ‚úÖ Admin status endpoint
- ‚úÖ Session creation
- ‚úÖ Audit logging

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL NOTES

1. **NEVER DELETE THESE ACCOUNTS**
   - They are your fail-safe
   - Even if you create other admins, keep these

2. **NEVER DISABLE admin_override TABLE**
   - This is your emergency access
   - Always keep it enabled

3. **BACKUP THIS INFORMATION**
   - Store credentials in multiple secure locations
   - You won't be able to recover if lost

4. **WORKS OFFLINE**
   - Admin bypass works even if:
     - Supabase is down
     - OAuth providers are unavailable
     - Internet is down (for localhost)

---

## üìû Support

If you ever get locked out:

1. Try admin bypass first
2. If admin bypass doesn't work, check:
   - Is auth gateway running?
   - Is Neon database accessible?
   - Are credentials correct?

3. Worst case - direct database access:
   ```bash
   # Connect to Neon directly
   psql "postgresql://neondb_owner:...@ep-xxx.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb"

   # Verify admin accounts exist
   SELECT * FROM auth_gateway.admin_override;
   ```
