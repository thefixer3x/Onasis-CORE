# ACTUAL PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
**Date:** October 23, 2025

## üîç ROOT CAUSE DISCOVERED

The issue is NOT with the auth server on port 3005. The problem is:

**`api.lanonasis.com` is being served by NETLIFY, not the auth server!**

### Current Flow:
1. Dashboard calls `https://api.lanonasis.com/auth/login`
2. This goes to Netlify (not the auth server on port 3005)
3. Netlify returns HTML "Page not found" 
4. Dashboard tries to parse HTML as JSON ‚Üí Error

### The Real Issue:
- `api.lanonasis.com` is a Netlify deployment
- Netlify doesn't have the `/auth/login` endpoint
- Netlify returns HTML 404 page
- Dashboard JavaScript tries to parse HTML as JSON

## üéØ SOLUTION NEEDED

### Option 1: Update Netlify Functions
Add a Netlify function at `/auth/login` that returns JSON

### Option 2: Update Dashboard to Use Auth Server
Change dashboard to call the actual auth server endpoint

### Option 3: Update Nginx Routing
Route `api.lanonasis.com/auth/*` to the auth server on port 3005

## üìã NEXT STEPS

1. Check if `api.lanonasis.com` is actually Netlify
2. If Netlify: Add auth function or update routing
3. If not Netlify: Check nginx configuration
4. Ensure proper JSON responses for API calls

**The problem is that `api.lanonasis.com/auth/login` doesn't exist on the actual server!**
