# PM2 Service Audit Summary - October 23, 2025

## Executive Summary
✅ **All services are stable** with no memory pressure issues detected
✅ **auth-gateway** has been stabilized with the TypeScript loader fix
✅ **Repo is ready** to commit changes matching production

---

## Memory Pressure Check Results

### No Memory Issues Found ✅
- **No memory leaks detected** in logs
- **No "out of memory" errors**
- **No fatal crashes** due to memory pressure
- **Heap usage is normal** (~92-93% on idle, which is expected)

### Current Service Status

#### auth-gateway (Instances 34 & 35)
- **Status**: Online, 0 restarts
- **Uptime**: 17+ hours (stable since fix)
- **Memory per instance**: ~22-23 MB
- **Heap usage**: 92-93% (normal for small heap sizes)
- **Event loop latency**: Excellent (0.6-0.7ms mean, 1.7ms p95)
- **Response time**: 2-3ms average
- **Traffic**: Low (0-0.03 req/min)

#### auth (Instance 21)
- **Status**: Online, 2 restarts
- **Uptime**: 2+ days
- **Health**: Responding correctly

#### mcp-core (Instance 19)
- **Status**: Online, 3 restarts
- **Uptime**: 3+ days
- **Health**: Responding correctly, handling API requests

## Changes Made to Stabilize Service

### Problem Identified
The auth-gateway was experiencing ESM module resolution errors that caused continuous crashes:
```
Error [ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND]: Cannot find module '/opt/lanonasis/services/auth-gateway/dist/config/env'
```

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Created TypeScript Loader (`start.js`)
Instead of running compiled JavaScript which had module resolution issues, we now use `tsx` to run TypeScript directly.

**Key change**: PM2 now runs `start.js` instead of `dist/index.js`

#### 2. Fixed Import Statements
Added `.js` extensions to all local imports in 11 TypeScript files to comply with Node.js ESM requirements.

## Next Steps

### To Commit These Changes:

```bash
cd /opt/lanonasis/onasis-core

# Review the changes
git diff --cached

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "fix(auth-gateway): stabilize PM2 service with TypeScript loader

- Add start.js TypeScript loader using tsx for runtime compilation
- Update ecosystem.config.js to use start.js instead of dist/index.js
- Add .js extensions to all ESM imports (11 files) for Node.js compatibility
- Fixes ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND errors that caused continuous service crashes
- Service now stable with 0 restarts and 17+ hours uptime

Changes from production deployment on Oct 22, 2025"

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

### For Local Development:

When you pull these changes locally, the services will run the same way as production:

1. **Development mode**: `npm run dev` (uses tsx watch)
2. **Production with PM2**: `pm2 start ecosystem.config.js` (uses start.js)
3. **Traditional build**: `npm run build && npm start` (still works)

All three approaches are now compatible and stable.

## Monitoring Recommendations

### Memory Monitoring
Current heap usage (92-93%) is **normal** for a small heap. Monitor if:
- Heap usage exceeds 95% consistently
- Memory grows over time without being garbage collected
- Service restarts unexpectedly

### Performance Monitoring
Current metrics look excellent:
- ✅ Event loop latency: < 2ms p95
- ✅ Response time: 2-3ms average
- ✅ No active request backlog

### Recommended Actions
1. **No immediate action needed** - service is stable
2. **Commit the changes** to sync repo with production
3. **Monitor heap growth** over next 24-48 hours to ensure no leaks
4. **Consider heap size increase** if memory usage grows (currently ~24MB)

---

## Technical Details

### Why Heap Usage is High But Normal
- Small heap size (~24MB) means high percentage usage is expected
- Actual memory usage is low (~22MB per instance)
- Node.js garbage collector will free memory when needed
- No signs of memory leak (stable usage over time)

### The Fix Explained
1. **Before**: TypeScript compiled to JS, Node.js ESM couldn't resolve modules
2. **After**: tsx handles TypeScript compilation at runtime with proper module resolution
3. **Result**: No build step required, no module resolution errors
