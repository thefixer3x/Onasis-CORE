## 🔍 **Technical Discoveries & Architecture Analysis**

### **Authentication Flow (Now Working)**
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User Login] --> B[auth.html]
    B --> C{return_to=dashboard?}
    C -->|Yes| D[dashboard-callback.js]
    D --> E[Set Secure Cookie]
    E --> F[Redirect to Dashboard]
    F --> G[✅ Authenticated Dashboard]
```

**Key Fix**: Modified auth.html to properly handle `return_to` parameter vs `redirect_url` for final destination routing.

### **MCP Integration Architecture (Partially Working)**
```mermaid

    CLI --> |Remote Mode| RM[Remote MCP Server]

## ⚠️ **Current Limitations & Issues**

### **🔴 Critical Issues**
1. **CLI Authentication Persistence**: Auth succeeds during login flow but doesn't persist between commands
   - `onasis status` shows "Authenticated: No" immediately after successful login
   - Token storage mechanism appears broken
   - Affects all memory operations

2. **MCP Connection Bug**: CLI MCP client ignores URL parameters and always tries local server path
   - Even with `--prefer-remote` and `--url` flags, still looks for local file
   - Blocking integration between CLI and deployed MCP server

3. **Memory Operations 404**: CLI memory commands fail with authentication errors
   - Related to auth persistence issue
   - `onasis memory list` returns "Authentication required"

### **🟡 Configuration Issues**
1. **Local MCP Server Missing**: CLI expects local server at hardcoded path
2. **Config File Location**: No CLI config files found in expected locations (`~/.config`, `~/.onasis*`)
3. **WebSocket Endpoint**: MCP WebSocket URL may need verification (`wss://mcp.lanonasis.com/ws`)

---

## 🚀 **Strengths & Working Components**

### **✅ Authentication Infrastructure**
- **Multi-domain auth working**: Successfully handles cross-subdomain authentication
- **Secure cookie system**: Properly configured with domain `.lanonasis.com`, SameSite=Lax, Secure flags
- **JWT validation**: Core auth system validates tokens correctly
- **OAuth Device Flow**: Complex auth flow implemented and functional

### **✅ MCP Server Deployment**
- **High uptime**: MCP server running for 23+ hours with stable performance
- **Health monitoring**: Both API and MCP endpoints return proper health responses
- **17 enterprise tools**: Complete tool suite deployed and accessible
- **Multi-protocol support**: REST API + MCP protocol + WebSocket capabilities

### **✅ Comprehensive Integration Plan**
- **Security-first design**: Vendor key validation and RLS enforcement planned
- **Unified SDK**: EnhancedMemoryClient v1.3.0 ready for multi-channel routing
- **IDE extensions**: VSCode, Cursor, Windsurf packages prepared
- **Documentation**: Detailed integration plan with roadmap

## 💡 **Key Insights & Learnings**

### **Authentication Architecture Success**
The centralized authentication through onasis-core with cross-subdomain cookie sharing is working excellently. The fix to use `return_to` parameter properly resolved the redirect loop that was frustrating users for 2+ months.

### **MCP Deployment Success**
The dual-subdomain approach (`api.lanonasis.com` + `mcp.lanonasis.com`) provides clean separation of concerns and both services are stable. The 23+ hour uptime on MCP server shows the VPS deployment is solid.

### **CLI Integration Challenge**
The CLI v2.0.6 has comprehensive MCP support built-in, but has two critical bugs preventing full functionality:
1. Authentication token persistence mechanism is broken
2. MCP client connection logic ignores remote URL parameters

### **Developer Experience Impact**
Once the CLI issues are resolved, the integrated ecosystem will provide:
- Seamless CLI → MCP → API → Supabase workflow
- 17 enterprise tools accessible from command line
- IDE integration with MCP channel detection
- Unified authentication across all channels

## 🔧 **Technical Debt & Refactoring Opportunities**

### **Code Quality**
- **Express routing**: Fixed wildcard route syntax in maas-api.js
- **Dependency management**: Resolved serverless-http compatibility
- **Error handling**: Auth errors now properly handled with redirects

### **Configuration Management**
- **Environment variables**: Well-organized per-app isolation
- **Secret management**: Supabase integration working correctly
